This repository contains the pretrained DenseNet models, source code, and data loading documentation for two versions of the project. Please visit the corresponding branches for each version:

## Versions:
- **[BSN2024](https://github.com/chen-darren/densenet-for-smartwatch-ppg/tree/BSN2024)**  
  This version is associated with the paper:  
  *"Smartwatch Photoplethysmogram-Based Atrial Fibrillation Detection with Premature Atrial and Ventricular Contraction Differentiation Using Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks"* by Darren Chen, Dong Han, Luis R. Mercado-Díaz, Jihye Moon, and Ki H. Chon, presented at the **2024 IEEE 20th International Conference on Body Sensor Networks (BSN)**.

- **[UConnThesis](https://github.com/chen-darren/densenet-for-smartwatch-ppg/tree/UConnThesis)**  
  This version corresponds to Darren Chen's Honors Undergraduate Thesis, titled:  
  *"Application of Deep Learning and Data Balancing Methods for Multiclass Cardiac Rhythm Detection and Classification Using Real-World Smartwatch Photoplethysmography"* at the **University of Connecticut**.

Keywords:

PPG: photoplethysmography
AF: atrial fibrilaltion
PAC/PVC or PAC_PVC: premature atrial and ventricular contractions
NSR: normal sinus rhythm
The study focuses on the Pulsewatch dataset to develop and evaluate deep learning models for detecting and classifying various cardiac rhythms using real-world smartwatch PPG data. This work strongly builds upon the DenseNet architecture and extends its application to cardiac rhythm classification using real-world smartwatch PPG data.
